# 🤖 Code Buddy – Your AI Programming Friend

**Code Buddy** is my final project for [Stanford’s Code in Place 2025](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) — a global classroom initiative taught by Stanford Professors [Chris Piech](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-piech-44b726a/) and [Mehran Sahami](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehransahami/).

An intelligent Python assistant that:

* ✅ Debugs your code like a pro
* 💡 Offers spicy hints (not spoilers!)
* 🌐 Runs in the terminal — no setup, no stress
* 🧠 Talks like your sarcastic, know-it-all programming buddy

## 📌 About the Project

**Code Buddy** is my final project for **[Stanford’s Code in Place 2025](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/)**
 — a global classroom initiative taught by Stanford Professors [Chris Piech](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-piech-44b726a/) and [Mehran Sahami](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehransahami/).


As a **TeachNow section leader**, I mentored fellow learners in debugging and understanding Python fundamentals. That inspired me to build **Code Buddy** — a 24x7 sarcastic, Gen-Z friendly assistant that helps beginners write better code, stress-free.

## ✨ Features

* **💬 Terminal-Based Chat**
  Talk to Buddy like you would to a TA. Paste code. Get real help.

* **🔍 GPT-Powered Hints**
  Get debugging help and logical hints using `openai` API (or any LLM).

* **🌐 Runs Anywhere**
  A pure Python-based CLI tool. No complex GUI. Works on low-end systems too.

* **🧒 Built for Beginners**
  Designed for those struggling with indentation, TypeErrors, or just life.

* **🔥 High Sarcasm Mode**
  Code Buddy roasts you gently when you miss a semicolon... again.

---

## 💪 Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 🐍
* **Model**: OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 via `openai`
* **Interface**: CLI (Command Line Interface)
* **Editor**: Any text editor + terminal

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Step 1: Paste your buggy code in a `.py` file

E.g., `buggy_code.py`

### Step 2: Run the assistant

```bash
python code_buddy.py
```

### Step 3: Choose your tool

* Debug code
* Get spicy hints
* Ask questions like: *"Why am I stuck in an infinite loop?"*

### Step 4: Boom. Fix. Learn.

Code Buddy reads your file, analyzes it, and replies with sarcastic but helpful hints.

## 🧪 Sample Output

```bash
Code Buddy 🤖: Whoa whoa whoa... you're trying to add a string and an int on line 4.
Hint: `int("10")` might save your life here.
Also, breathe. You're doing fine 🧠e
```
