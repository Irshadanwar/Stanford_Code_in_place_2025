# 🎓 Stanford_Code_in_place_2025

Welcome to my journey through [Stanford’s Code in Place 2025](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/), a global learning initiative designed to teach the fundamentals of computer science and programming using Python — for free, and with heart ❤️.

This repository documents everything from my coursework and project files to my final project:

## 🏫 What is Code in Place?

**Code in Place (CiP)** is an open online course offered by **Stanford University**, founded by Professors [Chris Piech](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-piech-44b726a/) and [Mehran Sahami](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehransahami/).

- 📆 **Duration**: 7 weeks (April–June 2025)
- 🧑‍🏫 **Taught by**: 2 Stanford Profs + 1,000+ volunteer teachers
- 🌍 **Global Reach**: Over 10,000 learners across 100+ countries
- 💡 **Languages & Tools**: Python, Karel, Turtle Graphics, Console-based games, Data structures, and more
- 🔁 **Format**: Weekly video lessons, interactive coding problems, and live section meetings with a volunteer instructor

It’s not just about learning to code — it’s about learning to think computationally, collaboratively, and creatively.

## 🚀 My Code in Place Journey

I was not just a student — I was selected as a **TeachNow section leader**, helping fellow learners debug and understand Python better.

### 📚 Weekly Highlights

| Week | Topics Covered |
|------|----------------|
| Week 1 | Introduction to Programming and Karel (visual logic problems) |
| Week 2 | Problem-solving, loops, conditions (Karel + puzzles) |
| Week 3 | Intro to Python: input, print, numbers, random, AI module |
| Week 4 | Control flow: if, while, for loops in Python |
| Week 5 | Graphics with Stanford’s custom graphics library |
| Week 6 | Data structures: lists, dictionaries, more fun problems |
| Week 7 | 🎉 Final Project Week — *Code Buddy* born! |

## 🤖 Code Buddy – Your AI Programming Friend

> *"An intelligent terminal-based AI assistant that helps beginners debug Python code while roasting them lovingly."* – Me (probably)

**Code Buddy** was my final project, built as a love letter to every beginner who’s ever cried over a `TypeError`.

### 🌟 Features

- ✅ Debugs your Python code intelligently using OpenAI GPT
- 💡 Offers hints without giving away spoilers
- 🧠 Sarcastic feedback like your techy friend who’s too cool for syntax errors
- 🧒 Beginner-friendly (and patient!)
- 📁 CLI-based — just run it in your terminal
